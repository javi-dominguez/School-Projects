# School-Projects
Projects made from classes or research at school.

Data.py:
This program was created during my time working under the guidance of Dr. Xiaoman Li at the University of Central Florida
Bioinformatics department. This program takes in large DNA sequencing data files and transforms them into an file that is easier
to manipulate for later use with a parsing program.

Overlap.py:
This program was created during my time working under the guidance of Dr. Xiaoman Li at the University of Central Florida
Bioinformatics department. This program takes in preprocessed DNA sequencing data from another program (such as Data.py) and 
parses it to recognize any overlaps in proteins between DNA modules.

Assignments 3-6:
These programs are various tasks oriented on learning specific C commands. These were made for class assignments.
